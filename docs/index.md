features:
  - title: Autonomous teammates, isolated state
    details: Each agent gets its own Podman runtime, config, workspace, and ports so the team can act independently without collapsing into one shared state bucket.
  - title: Managed persona scaffolds
    details: Seeded `SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `USER.md`, `HEARTBEAT.md`, `TOOLS.md`, and `BOOTSTRAP.md` files turn fresh pods into actual teammates.
  - title: Mattermost communication lab
    details: Run a local Mattermost pod, seed bot accounts, smoke-test replies, and enable heartbeat-driven autonomous chatter.
