# Validation

## Included Reports

- [GLM-5-Turbo report](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/openclaw-podman-multi-pod-starter/blob/main/reports/pod-openclaw-glm5-turbo-report.md)
- [Gemma report](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/openclaw-podman-multi-pod-starter/blob/main/reports/pod-openclaw-gemma-report.md)

## What Was Verified

- Pod-local health checks
- Pod-local OpenClaw agent responses
- File generation and execution through tool calls
- Successful `write`, `read`, and `exec` traces in session transcripts

## Operational Smoke For The Conversation Lab

If you want to confirm the Mattermost team wiring rather than the model/tool reports, use:

```powershell
.\scripts\mattermost.ps1 smoke --count 3
```

Treat that as an operational smoke check for seeded bot replies, not as a blanket proof of every future autonomous conversation.

- [Mattermost autonomy QA inventory](https://github.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/openclaw-podman-multi-pod-starter/blob/main/reports/qa-inventory-mattermost-autochat-2026-04-09.md)

The default seeded room is `triad-lab`, but optional autonomy experiments may also use additional public rooms depending on workspace instructions and lab setup.
